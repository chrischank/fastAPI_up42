## UP42 Geospatial Engineering Challenge ðŸš€

The goal of this challenge is to create a simple API in Python that, for a provided geometry, searches a Sentinel-2 satellite scene and computes the average NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) value.

### Result

For this exercise, 3 Endpoints were created.
The first of these is a simple proof of concept (using GET).
The other two generate the requested result but with GET and POST, giving the option to experiment with a geojson both as a file and as direct code.
